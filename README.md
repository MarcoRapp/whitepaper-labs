# 🧠 Whitepaper Labs: AI Memory & Contextual Relevance Research

Welcome to **whitepaper-labs**, a public repository dedicated to the development, refinement, and documentation of memory systems in large language models (LLMs).  
This project explores core concepts of **memory flagging**, **contextual polling**, and **semantic memory management**.

---

## 📄 Included Whitepapers

- **Polling-Based Flagging System for Context Relevance in AI Memory Development**  
  Focused on structured relevance evaluation and memory pruning mechanisms.

- **Memory Management & Personality Layering in AI Systems**  
  Proposes a three-tier memory structure to separate user profiles, active project state, and AI identity evolution.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Establish practical architectures for **long-term memory handling** in LLMs  
- Develop transparent, controllable systems for **personality retention and pruning**  
- Enhance memory relevance using **polling-based interaction signals**  
- Contribute real-world benchmarks and concepts (e.g. _VendingBench_, _Contextual Drift Metrics_)
